The best feedback management;You have a very efficient review management system. Very honest and only real reviews are published, whether positive or negative. Customer service was the best I have ever seen. Quick response and very professional behavior. I would recommend collect reviews to everyone. Good job collecting reviews team.;;Sally;5;2019-06-17T20:39:07
Best provider I came across.;This is the best review provider. I came across a very helpful team that is easy to set up and offers very responsive customer care. I would recommend this company.;;Jonathan Townshend;5;2019-01-06T20:35:53
Increase visitor numbers and customer service;I use collect reviews in several online shops that I own and I can definitely measure an increased number of visitors in each shop. The customer service was always friendly and responded to my inquiries, recommended !!!;;ovidiu-george stoica;5;2018-12-04T22:49:46
Extremely reliable;As a company specializing in the online sale of French and German auto parts, we are very customer-oriented. Our ethos is 100% satisfaction across the board as a minimum standard. The system of collect reviews enables control over reviews, since an answer can be published alongside the review with an explanation / apology / argument, but the setup is very transparent for the company. If there is criticism, this should apply to the company controlled as YOU. I believe that in the past the system could be manipulated so that only positive reviews could be viewed, but was spoken to a Collect representative. The procedure has recently been changed to prevent this. Let's be realistic. ANY online reviews are a guide, not a guarantee. After all, you can pay 100 students to write glowing reviews if you want. So let's not shoot the messenger.;;Chris;5;2018-10-23T15:37:33
With collect reviews, companies are guaranteed to give REAL customer feedback;We have been using collect reviews for about 8 months to collect customer reviews for our e-commerce companies and are very happy with their services! Collecting customer reviews is a very simple process. The customer login area is very user-friendly. The price is much lower than other competitors and the service provided by the online and telephone representatives is always a great and fun experience. I would recommend Collect Reviews to any ecommerce company looking for an easy and inexpensive way to collect customer reviews.;;Graham Tyers;5;2018-10-15T20:46:26
Fixes bugs in public reviews;If you don't have to be a buyer of a product to rate it, you can't trust reviews. And if you can leave an irrelevant comment as a reason for a 1 or 2 star rating (e.g. I wanted to order on Christmas Eve but they don't deliver) it will be more difficult for the end user. A third-party provider that filters the ratings makes a lot more sense than the retailer who filters the ratings itself. I would like to see more companies adopt the collect reviews approach.;;RuthD;4;2018-09-27T07:51:14
Totally fair reviews must work in both directions.;"With the greatest respect for customers who have had bad experiences with bad service providers, I understand your frustration because I was in the same situation myself. Nobody is perfect, every feedback always has two sides, and ""the circumstances can sometimes be beyond the supplier's sphere of influence"", e.g. B. Bad weather, third parties and freight forwarders who can let even the most professional and best organized companies down. I firmly believe that it is your reaction to resolve the situations that make the difference. In my opinion, the arbitration process for collecting evaluations is really fair for both parties, as it enables the supplier to explain the situation specific to your feedback and to offer a solution to your considerations. Whether you are satisfied with the solution or not, if you respond within the given time (within this time frame (both parties have the same time constraints), your negative feedback will be published along with your supplier's comments). This is certainly the fairest way for everyone, as future visitors can get an idea of ​​the relevance of the feedback by reading a balance of both points of view.";;Terry Malone;5;2018-09-04T11:24:53
I find the reviews of collect reviews trustworthy;I have used collect reviews on websites in the UK and Germany. I find it very imaginative, especially when buying across borders. Once I had a problem with the delivery and gave the seller negative feedback. After I passed the Abitration, my feedback was published. I never felt that they were;;The Office Agent;5;2018-07-27T02:25:14
5 stars to collect, unlike Trustpilot;I've been at CR for ** and ** for almost 3 years, everything is without any problems, helpful customer service, I refused to pay the high price for Trustpilot, I believe that Trustpilot uses the mafia tactic, with which you can solve any problems that arise with cr.de - 5 stars ;;Julia Kedziora;5;2017-11-03T13:57:14

Just to calm your mind, we are ...;To reassure you, we use the C-R platform as a platform for collecting reviews. All ratings are displayed with no rating difference. The only difference is, how is setup or were the review left hat. Since you may only be able to see the ratings on the platform or if the settings are different, the ratings will also be displayed on the platforms on which the collector wishes to display them. If anyone has any doubts, I can give my account as an example, and we've collected just over 1000 reviews so far, and they have all been shown.;;Roy Raza;4;2019-08-23T14:09:13
Collective reviews - the best evaluation platform So far we have used.;We have been using Collect for over a year and find that the simple integrations take care of our product and company reviews. If you have a support request, nothing seems to be too much trouble. After looking at all the relevant providers before signing up for c-r.com, we believe we made the right choice. It appears that TrustPilot allows all types of ratings for a company that is completely irrelevant to the company. When you read, you should probably ignore those who complain about products, they don't sell hats or fits.;;Moon;5;2019-06-08T15:10:44
Great service and features;We had been considering using a review platform for a while and came across collect-reviews.co.uk after buying a small article online and receiving a very professional review on their platfor (£ 1200 a month) and CR were perfect from start to finish and we did the integration in less than a day.;;Peter Maxwell;5;2017-11-25T15:08:30
A really good review provider (even for a small business);I switched from Trustpilot to these people. After two months of being set up, I can report that everything is going really smoothly, and as a small business, the packages on offer are really good value and do a lot more than just reviews. Customer service was great - every time there was a problem it was resolved. If I have only one criticism, I can only create a bespoke review invitation that is technically a little tiring to go beyond the normal layouts, but once that is done, everything works fine. They also have a link that you can enter in emails so you don't get spam. And the best part is that my customers leave feedback - their own feedback is quick and easy to use. I would also recommend.;;Bill;5;2018-10-17T09:12:28

;Trustpilot tracks you with sales calls, false claims of the benefits of using your SEO. Collect reviews have a relaxed approach, an affordable approach and they don't track you with calls day after day with wrong sales calls. Like on Earth there are negative reviews here, I don't know. I can only imagine that they are wrong.;;Simon Francis;5;2013-02-01T12:31:56
